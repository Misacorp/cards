# Cards
Custom card stack creator. This project aims to allow users to create custom stacks of cards, share their creations, and view others' stacks by randomly drawing cards from them.

## Planned features
The following features are planned:

* Create cards with a **title**, **text** and **faction**.
* Customize faction colors either by giving users full control over colors, or providing color schemes.
* Share created card stacks via link.

The following features are being considered:
* Allow collaboration on stack creation. Multiple users can manipulate cards in the same stack.
* Limited draw: Users can only draw a limited number of cards from the stack to form their "hand". (optional)
* Draw a card from a specific faction. (optional)

## Uses
The tool can function in various scenarios where the order of received information is irrelevant.

Want to display both sides to a debated topic? Create a stack with arguments from both sides. Having trouble deciding where to eat? Create a stack of your favourite restaurants and draw one. Too many chores to do? Put them in a stack, then draw and complete them one at a time.
